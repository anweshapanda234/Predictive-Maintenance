Predictive Maintenance for Safety-Critical Machines

Overview
ML predicts machine failures via sensor data analysis, enabling proactive maintenance for improved safety and reduced downtime.

Tech Stack
Python
Pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Approach
Preprocessed and analyzed sensor data
Trained ML models to detect failure patterns
Evaluated performance using standard metrics

Outcome
The model successfully learned failure trends and demonstrated how machine learning can support reliable and data-driven maintenance decisions.

Future Scope
